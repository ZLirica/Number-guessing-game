# Number-guessing-game

Just a simple number guessing game. 
This is my first project with Pyhton so if you read it and find some space for improvement, please let me know. I'd love to get your feedback.

It's quite a common project for beginner therefore there's a lot of places to take guidance from so some parts might look like something you've already seen before. I did add some creativity on my end to make it more mine but i'm still a complete beginner so... let's hope it's enough :). 

Never yours,
