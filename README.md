# Question-generator-game-for-friends

Just a simple question generator game. It chooses amongst the questions given to it and displays it. It's meant to be a game to play between friends, to get to know each other better. 

This is my first project with Pyhton so if you read it and find some space for improvement, please let me know. I'd love to get your feedback.

I took some guidance from "Tech with Tim" on Youtube (https://youtu.be/21FnnGKSRZo?si=LLHyC25zrl19Cy12) so some parts might look similar. I did add some creativity on my end to make it more mine but i'm still a complete beginner so... let's hope it's enough :). 

Never yours,
ZLirica
